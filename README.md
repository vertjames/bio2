## Project 1: InterviewEQ

[InterviewEQ](https://maximilliancharlemagne.github.io/emotion-engine/) is a web app designed to help development job seekers improve their soft skills. Using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) we convert the user's speech to text, then analyze prominent emotions in that text using the [ParallelDots Emotion Analysis API](https://www.paralleldots.com/text-analysis-apis#emotion), and display the results of that analysis for the user.
